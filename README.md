# rusty-riscv-ave: A simple riscv64 emulator in rust

inspired by rvemu and Rare.

Just for my personal study.

## TODOS
My implementation works fine in previous 9 steps, but failed to boot xv6's kernel in the last lab, 
so I use the cpu.rs from rare, it just works.

I'm trying to figure out the reason now, I'm so tired.
